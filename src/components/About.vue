    <strong>Are you tracking me or using cookies?</strong>
    <p>
      Although this site doesn't use cookies, your last sim configuration is saved
      into your local storage for convenience. Other than that it's pretty much
      a static page with no database or tracking.
    </p>

    <strong>Is it open source?</strong>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/rafaelpimpa/furysim"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Yes</a> â€” GPL-3.0.
    </p>

    <strong>Does it have a light/dark theme?</strong>
    <p>Yes, it should change based on your system preference.</p>

    <strong>Where did you get the formulas? How spell X works?</strong>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/rafaelpimpa/furysim/blob/master/MECHANICS.md"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Read about the mechanics</a>
      if you're interested. Sources are there too.
    </p>

    <strong>Found a bug. Where do I report?</strong>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/rafaelpimpa/furysim/issues"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Here</a>. But post a valid source or insta-closed.
    </p>

    <strong>What's the tech used?</strong>
    <p>
      The simulator itself runs in pure Javascript (Web Worker).
      Interface is the default stack from
      <a href="https://cli.vuejs.org/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Vue CLI</a>.
      CSS lib is
      <a href="https://acahir.github.io/Barebones/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Barebones</a> with a bit of changes.
    </p>

    <strong>Why did you make this?</strong>
    <p>
      Always wanted to learn how to simulate something. Also wanted to know if Flurry
      Axe is worth buying. Spoiler: <span class="spoiler">Not much.</span>
